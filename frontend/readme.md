# Raffle

A simple raffle application.

## Installation

For the frontend sources use 
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the API server.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Development
For the frontend, run the npx live-server. Since there is no hot reloading  
```bash
npm run start
```
Since there is no hot reloading for esbuild, run 
```bash
npm run build
```
after code changes being made. The live-server then reflects the changes
```python
import foobar

```
